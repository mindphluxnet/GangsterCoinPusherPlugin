# Unfixed bugs

- The Hood screen always displays an upgrade indicator (green arrow) on the Jewelry Store even if it can't be upgraded.
- Sometimes, a boss car spawns without an actual boss in it. This prevents another boss from spawning until you restart the game.
- Despite silver coins being capped they don't regenerate while offline. Not sure if that's intentional.
- If you want to repair a building while having insufficient dollars you'll get stuck as the repair window can't be closed.

# Won't fix

- There are various steps in community tasks awarding obscene amounts of diamonds (60k and more!) while the other steps only award a paltry amount. While unlikely to be intended (~6.8k diamonds are like $80) it's not a bug I'm greatly worried about :)
- The Steam achievement to reach 200 hood upgrade stars can't be reached as the maximum obtainable is 105. This also means the in-game achievement for 110 stars isn't reachable. As community fixes for unobtainable achievements are greatly frowned upon I'm not going to bother even though it would be easy to fix.
- Community tasks end at some point as they require the player to reach level 100 (and the game is capped to 30).

# Known plugin bugs
- Refining a prop from shards doesn't make the "refine" button disappear immediately. Not a big deal as you can't click it twice and it disappears soon enough but still, annoying.
