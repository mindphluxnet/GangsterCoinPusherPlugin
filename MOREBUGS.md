# Unfixed bugs

- The Hood screen still shows the upgrade button at the highest rank (5)
- The Hood screen always displays an upgrade indicator (green arrow) on the Jewelry Store even if it can't be upgraded.
- Sometimes, a boss car spawns without an actual boss in it. 
- Despite silver coins being capped they don't regenerate while offline. Not sure if that's intentional.

# Won't fix

- There are various steps in community tasks awarding obscene amounts of diamonds (60k and more!) while the other steps only award a paltry amount.
- The Steam achievement to reach 200 hood upgrade stars can't be reached as the maximum obtainable is 105. This also means the in-game achievement for 110 stars isn't reachable.

# Known plugin bugs
- Refining a prop from shards doesn't make the "refine" button disappear immediately. Not a big deal as you can't click it twice and it disappears soon enough but still, annoying.
