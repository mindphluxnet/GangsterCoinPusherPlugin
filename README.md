# Gangster Coin Pusher Plugin
Collection of fixes for the game "Gangster Coin Pusher":

- Fixes collection of dolls/props not saving between sessions. Considering how many of them exist and that they are required for upgrading the cannon the collection was clearly not ment to be session-only.
- Fixes the Lucky Wheel dropping "Pig Skill" or "AdvSkill" which are both basically dud "rewards".
- Fixes the equipped skill breaking the game completely once the skill is fully upgraded.
- Fixes Steam achievements not unlocking directly after achieving them.
- Fixes the audio setting not saving. Small caveat: there's still about half a second of music on startup.
- Fixes the game not running in the background on Alt+Tab. Also mutes the game when it's not focused.
- Moved the translation data outside of the game files and fixed some translations to be less terrible (work in progress).
